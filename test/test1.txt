JAVA 

1.java: Java is object oriented programming and high level language.
       * If we need to run the program we should hava ".java" extension.
	   
  javac: javac is java compiler which helps to run the program.
	   * While complie the program it should have commad "javac filename.java"
  
  
2.JDK[Java Development Kit]: It is used for developing the programs like java.

  JRE[Java Runtime Enivronment]: It is used for runtime (or) complie time with the libaray fuctions.
   
  JVM[Java Virtual Machine]:Itis platform to run the program with  virtual machine .
  
  
3.Limitations of array:
	*We can only store similar type of datatypes.
	*We should sort the elements.
	*We cannot directly initialize the array.
	*It has fixed size.
	*Insertion and deletion is difficult.
	

4.class:class is non primitive, which contains objects and variables.
		Syntax: class class_name{
		
				}
		ex:     class Test{
		
				}


  object:It is real world entity
  
  Signature of the class: It as access specifers, class and object.
  
5.Array:Array is a collection of tables and columns under the same elements and it is a data structure and non primitive.
        Syntax:
				datatype[] variable_name={n1,n2,n3..};
		Ex:
				String[] snacks={"Gobi", "Pani puri", "chips", "cake"}
				

6.  .java file: .java file is written in english by humans and it can be read, write or update it.

	.class file: .class file it is platform independent where javac compiles the java program and then it creates a .class file where it can be compiled in any java platform .
	
7.length=6
	
	
8.Method signature: method signature which have method name and parameter name.
	syntax:class Test{
				
			static void java{
					System.out.print("First test\n");
			}
			
			public static void main(String[] args){
				Test.java();
			}
		}


9.Java: Java is high level language programming with platform independent. It isliableobject oriented, secured and  reliable.


10. variable: variable are used to store the reference values.
			sytnax:
					data_type variable_name;
			ex:
					int marks;

11.class variable: class variable is also known as static variable.
			syntax: static data_type variable_name{
					}
			ex:   static String marks{
					}
					

12.datatype:It is used to declare the variables.
	types of datatype
		i.primitive:it as
						-byte
						-short
						-int
						-long
						-float
						-double
						-char
						-boolean
						
		ii.non-primitive:It as
						-String
						-class
						
13. Features of  Java
	*platform independent
	*High performance
	*Easy to learn
	*Object Oriented Programming
	*Memory management
	
14.Types of array
	i.1D[One dimensional array]: It is used for linear sequnece.
			ex: int[] num={1,3,4,5};
			
	ii.2D[Two dimensional array]: It is used for rows and columns.
			ex: int[] row={2,4,6,8};
				int[] columns={1,3,5,6}
	iii.Multi dimensional array: It is used for More than 2D 
	
16. System.out.println("");  
		It is used to print the message.
	System.out.println(""); 
		where, System is pre-defined class name
			   out is static variable
			   println is static method
			   ("") is Statement
			   . ; is operator
			   
			   
17.== is used to comparing two variables (or) checking it is equal or not


18. . operator is used to access the class, methods and members.


19.Base class of all the classes is object.
		class Mytest{
		
		}
